# 6th-sem-mini-project

This repository consists of all the files related to an android app mini project that 
I had created in my 6th semester of Engineering.
I had no prior knowledge or experience about android app development when I just started building this app. 
I was learning android app development through youtube videos and building the app side by side.
But the app is around 90% perfect. The rest 10% coudn't be achieved due to lack of learning resources.

The code consists of multiple classes and can be found in the following directory:
app/src/main/java/com/varun/propertyguidance

To install the app download the app-release.apk file
