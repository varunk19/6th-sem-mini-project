# 6th-sem-mini-project

This repository consists of all the files related to an android app mini project that 
I had created in my 6th semester of Engineering.
I had no prior knowledge or experience on android app development. 
I was learnt a small portion of it through youtube videos and built the app simultaneously through what I had learnt.
But the app couldn't be a 100% perfect due to lack of learning resources.

The code consists of multiple classes and can be found in the following directory:
app/src/main/java/com/varun/propertyguidance

To install the app download the app-release.apk file
